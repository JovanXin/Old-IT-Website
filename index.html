        <h1>Welcome to this website! This website discusses the important games in gaming history</h1>

        <h2>A quick overview</h2>
        <h3>1) Tetris</h3>
        <p>Tetris was revolutionary. The first time I played it, I spent hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours playing it. I was a teenager at the time, and I’d go from playing from about 8pm to 2am, then I’d go to bed, then I’d get up and do it again.

            There was something about the game that just got me. I just never wanted to stop playing. I enjoyed the puzzle aspect of the game, I enjoyed the challenge, I enjoyed the strategy.
            
            I remember sometimes I’d play for hours until I could finally get the “next block” to line up just right. Finally, I’d have a string of 4 blocks, and I would have to wait until the next block was about to come, and then I’d have to wait for the block to fall so I could stack it on top of the next block. If I timed it right, I could get a T-spin, which was worth more points. Or, if I was really lucky, I could get a spin that had 3 blocks aligned with 4 blocks in the next column, which would get me an even higher score.
            
            And get this. I wasn’t just playing for a high score. I was playing for a high score to impress a girl I had a crush on. I’d play in front of her, and show her my amazing Tetris skills. And then she would laugh at me.
            </p>
        <h3>2) Pacman</h3>
        <p>Most games were about annihilation [at the time Pac-Man was released]. Most games were World War-themed or aggressive games. Here was a game that was none of those things. There was no weapon to fire. It was: Outrun your pursuers until you are of sufficient strength that you can then chase them. And what it really wound up doing was it changed the social dialogue around arcades.</p>
